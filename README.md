 #Employee-Performance-Management-System

The data is supervised and categorical. The predictor variables are ordinal and a few among them are nominal. The target variable 'Performance Rating' is ordinal.
To analyze the data, various data processing techniques like Label Encoding and Standardization is used. Correlation Coeffecient is used to interpret the relationship between variables. The most important features selected are Department, Job Role, Environment Satisfaction, Last Salary Hike Percent, Work Life Balance.
For training the data and predicting the target, algorithms used are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor.
A separate analysis of Department wise Performance is to be carried out. Data Analysis Summary.

** Summary -**

The project is to be done with the purpose of finding out factors which affect the Performance of the employees, training a model which accurately predicts the Performance Rating of the employee, analyzing the data to provide recommendations to improve the performance and gain insights from the analysis. The following steps are needed to be carried out:

(a) Import the data provided, find out the predictor & target variables and look for missing values.

(b) Analysis of Department wise performance as asked.

(c) Label Encoding the ordinal columns.

(d) Calculate correlation coefficient to find out the relationship between variables and then select the important features for analysis.

(e) Standardizing the data and splitting it into test and train.

(f) Training the data using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour and checking the accuracy to find out which algorithm is the best.

(g) Exporting the model with highest accuracy.
